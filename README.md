# [React-Portfolio]

This repository details the progression of my personal portfolio built with a React Front-End. I have compiled some of my projects & assighnments I've completed since joining the full stack development class at Southern Methodist University. 


<h1>Overview:</h1>
Whenever initializing a React application, all of the Front-End starter code is produced for you. This simplified the overall architecture of the application due to the fact I could store all my components in one directory.
